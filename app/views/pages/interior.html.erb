    <h2>Bed bugs</h2>
    <p>It may be possible to reduce the bed bug population in your home, but it is virtually impossible to eliminate every bug without the services of a pest
      management professional. If even one adult female survives, your home could become re-infested. Sleeping in a different room or vacating the structure
       is not a solution and can make the problem more difficult to eliminate. DIY treatments almost always make a pest problem arose and more expensive in
       the long run. We will do it right the first time. Don’t lose another night of sleep, call us!</p>
